# Time_series_forecasting with LSTMs

This project  focuses on forecasting PM2.5 air pollution levels using LSTM recurrent neural networks. 
Trained on Beijing PM2.5 data, this project provides real-time forecasts to help mitigate health risks and air pollution levels.


Dataset
The dataset consists of two files:

train.csv: Contains historical air quality and weather data for training the model.

test.csv: Contains data for making predictions and submitting to Kaggle.

Key Features:

DEWP: Dew point temperature.


TEMP: Temperature.


PRES: Pressure.

Iws: Cumulated wind speed.

pm2.5: PM2.5 concentration (target variable).
